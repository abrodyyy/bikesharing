Module 15: NY Citibike with Tableau

## Overview: 
After utilizing Citi Bike, a bike-sharing app while visiting New York, we have decided to look into the possibility of starting a similar company in Des Moines, Iowa. The purpose of this analysis is to examine New York Citi Bike data and determine if a bike share brogram could be sucessful in Des Moines. While the two cities are vastly different, we can still utilize the information to make informed decisions about the business potential in Des Moines. For our analysis, we'll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype in our citibike dataset. We'll then export our updated dataset and take advantage of Tableau's data visualization tools to create a presentation for potential investors. 

This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report to present our results:
- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
    - Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
    - Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    - Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

## Summary & Reccomendations: 
Based on our analysis, we can infer that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines has the potential to be both sucessful and profitable. There is a demand for both residents and tourists visiting. As we saw significantly more subscribers than customers, we can determine that we will have a steady flow of business from riders that may use the service to commute to and from work. In the future I would reccomend gaining additional data such as fares during peak hours and long term profits for additional visualizations.
